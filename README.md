# Energy Consumption Prediction

This repository contains a Streamlit application that predicts energy consumption based on various environmental and operational factors using a Linear Regression model. The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and is built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn.

## Overview
The Energy Consumption Prediction app is designed to forecast the energy consumption of a facility using logistic regression. The prediction is based on input features such as temperature, humidity, square footage, occupancy, renewable energy usage, and more.

## Features
- **Predict Energy Consumption**: Input various factors and predict whether the energy consumption will be categorized as high or low.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Data Visualization**: Basic visualizations to understand the impact of different features on energy consumption.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-consumption-prediction.git
   cd energy-consumption-prediction
